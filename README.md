## 📜 

This is not a chatbot. It is an **Agentic Framework** that acts as a Chief Engineer, Sourcing Manager, and Physics Simulator in one. It takes a prompt, validates the physics, finds the real parts in stock, and generates the files to build it.

**We are building the "Linux of Manufacturing."**

---

## 🧠 How It Works
Unlike standard LLMs which hallucinate physical specifications, We Use a **Hardware-Aware architecture**. It grounds its creativity in reality by using Computer Vision to read datasheets, Python simulations to validate flight physics, and OpenSCAD to generate physical geometry.

### The "Self-Healing" Loop
The core differentiator is the **Optimization Agent**. If the sourced parts fail the physics simulation (e.g., TWR < 1.5), the system doesn't error out. It *reasons* about the failure, swaps components (e.g., "Upgrade motors from 2207 to 2306"), and re-simulates until it passes.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **⚛️ Data Fusion Sourcing:** Orchestrates parallel searches across multiple vendors (Amazon, GetFPV, Pyrodrone). It merges the best *pricing* data with the best *technical* data to create a "Composite Component."
*   **👁️ Multimodal Vision Verification:** Uses **Gemini Pro Vision** to "look" at product images and extract critical engineering constraints (e.g., measuring bolt patterns from a JPEG) that are missing from text descriptions.
*   **🚀 Physics Sandbox:** Runs a Dockerized physics engine to calculate Thrust-to-Weight Ratios (TWR), Disk Loading, and estimated flight times *before* you buy a single part.
*   **📐 Generative CAD:** Dynamically generates `.scad` and `.stl` files for the frame, tailored to the exact dimensions of the sourced components.
*   **⚡ Automated Electrical Schematics:** Generates a visual wiring diagram (PNG) showing exactly how to connect the specific peripherals (GPS, Receiver, VTX) to the selected Flight Controller.

## 🤝 Contributing & Roadmap

**This project is community-driven.** We are looking for contributors to help expand beyond drones into other hardware verticals (Robotics, IoT, PCBs).

*   [ ] **Add New Scrapers:** Help us support DigiKey, Mouser, and AliExpress.
*   [ ] **Improve Physics:** Add drag coefficient calculations for different frame geometries.
*   [ ] **Frontend:** Port the dashboard to React/Next.js.

**Found a bug?** Open an issue.
**Have a feature idea?** Join the discussion on [Discord](Link_To_Discord) or submit a PR.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

*   **Safety:** Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries and high-speed propellers are dangerous. This tool generates *theoretical* designs. Always verify wiring diagrams and physics calculations manually.
*   **Scraping:** The reconnaissance module uses a headless browser to scrape public e-commerce data. Respect `robots.txt` and rate limits.
